                                        The next major aspect of permanent residence is the work permit aspect.
                                        Permanent residents can work for any employer in any occupation. But, working in
                                        the Public Service or Armed forces is strictly restricted to the Australian
                                        Citizens. This, however, does not distinguish the industrial laws between the
                                        permanent residents and citizens. Permanent residents enjoy the same benefits
                                        under these laws as the citizens. They can become a part of trade unions and can
                                        claim worker’s compensation.
